   Problem 3.1.19 in Algorithms book ch. 3.1
   
   Code changes are made from line 83 onward, 
   Two ArrayLists were made to hold the Words and the Counts
   The for loop that was in place to find the highest frequency count was used
   to find the top 10 words in The Tale of Two Cities.
   1. Loop 10 times - for 10 words
   2. Insert the highest frequency word & its count into their respective 
      ArrayLists topWords and topCount
   3. Delete the max word from the table.
   4. The loop restarts without the previous max word, therefore finding the
      next highest frequency word and so on until the loop ends. 
   5. Display the contents of both arrays.

    NOTE- taleTwo.txt is what I named my Tale of Two Cities txt file. It will be
          included in the same GitHub folder.
